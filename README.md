## What is this repository?

This repository is an assignement asked by our current teacher Georgios Tsatiris. The assignement was the following:

1. Build a data type of your choice (class, struct), to represent one real-world set of entities (e.g. Students, Cars, Products, etc.). Think of appropriate attributes in each case (e.g. year of enrolment, name, etc.)

2. Create instances/objects of your data type and store them in a Data Structure of your choice (e.g. list, vector, BST). Optimally, the data structure should follow your own implementation. Data can be randomly generated.

3. Implement addition, retrieval, updating and removal functionalities, through a simple console menu.
Implement a version of Merge Sort, to sort your data structure based on a "sortable" attribute (e.g. year of enrolment, name)
Support any function that depends on search (retrieval, updating and removal), with your implementation of Binary Search (or, optionally, a 
suitable tree structure).

1. Maintain a public remote repository on GitHub, with just the necessary documentation on how to build and run your code. Include a short description about what your project does and what limitations it may have (bugs, unfinished tasks, etc.).

Moreover, this assignment is due on 12 January 2025.

## How to use?

### As a user

To use this progam as a user, just double click on the executable and follow the instructions.

> ⚠️ **Attention**: This program only works on windows machines.


### As a programmer

If you wish to read or modify the source code of this program here are some information you might need:

- To call the different functions, you only have to call the file "assignment.h" to your .cpp file.
- Due to the way I have made this program, the differents features are not made to work with other data structure and do not support new element. If you wish to modify the current data structure, most of the code would need to be reworked.
